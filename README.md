### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

After three years in academic publishing, I followed my passion for technology and software devlopment and enrollend in the webdevelopment bootcamp @lewagon. Many challenges and a final project later, I'm still in love with coding and look forward to all the amazing things there are to learn. Next on the list is a deep dive into C! âœ¨

Have a look at our [AirBnB-Clone](https://github.com/malteasmuth/MySpaceShip) or the [final project](https://github.com/malteasmuth/TreasureKeeper)!

More to come ...

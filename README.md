### Hello! 👋

After three years in academic publishing, I am now following my passion for technology and software development and recently graduated from the web development bootcamp @lewagon. Many challenges and a final project later, I'm still in love with coding and look forward to all the amazing things there are still to learn. Next on the list is a deep dive into C! ✨

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malteasmuth/) and send me your favorite C challenge.

- Ruby
- SQL
- ActiveRecord
